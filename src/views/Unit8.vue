                <p class="text-justify lead">From the information and knowledge covered in both Law203 and Law204, we should be able to appreciate and understand the various components of a contract. In this last unit, we focus on the drafting of contracts. We will focus on the main averments that should be included when drafting a contract. These include being able to identify the parties, describing the parties, nature and heading of a contract, definition and interpretation clauses, essential elements, suspensive conditions and general clauses. Many contracts are concluded informally, but contracts of a commercial nature are generally concluded or reflected in writing. The contractual document is the instrument that reflects the agreement between the parties and it usually the primary evidence relied upon to enforce contractual rights.</p>
                <h5 class="h5">Contents</h5>
                <p>This Unit is divided into eight (8) key areas:</p>

                  <p>It is vitally important to note that a party must be an independent legal subject<sup>198</sup>. The following should be determined before the parties enter into a contract:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The nature of the entity (for example, a registered corporation or merely a natural person trading under another name)</li>

                  <p>It is good practice to always provide as much information as possible to identify the parties at the head of the agreement<sup>200</sup>. For legal certainty, at the head of an agreement, the full names and identity numbers as well as the status of the natural person should appear. In the case of juristic or legal person, the full name (such as the company name identified by the wording (Pty) Ltd) and possible identity numbers such as the company registration number should appear. A company registration number remains constant, even though the company name may change. Where no registration number is available, the principal place of business can be used.</p>

                <p>A contract does not require the heading “contract” to identify it as such as its content will indicate its nature. However, terms used as heading include “agreement” “contract” or a name specifying the specific nominate contract concluded such as “Purchase and Sale Agreement”. A contract will be a nominate contract if it contains the required essentialia for that type of nominate contract even though the contract is not specifically identified in name.</p>

                  <p>A Memorandum of Understanding or MoU is also a valid and binding contract if reflects consensus between the parties. An MoU is usually a preliminary, short and basic contract that creates a binding a legal obligation between the parties in anticipation of successful negotiations on the finer and more intricate details of the relationship that the parties envisage. Any subsequent agreement on these outstanding issues and the drafting of a comprehensive formal main contract document could either completely substitute, or only complement the provisions in the initial MoU.</p>

                <p>The date of the agreement is the date on which it has been executed by all parties to the agreement. If parties sign on different dates, the date of the agreement is the date when the last party signs. According to Hutchison<sup>202</sup>, the agreement date is important for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>One practical reason is so that the agreement may be referred to at a later date (for example, the agreement between A and B dated   X). </li>
                  <li>The date will provide clarity regarding the statues, rules and regulations that were in operation at the time of conclusion, as well as determine the contractual capacity of the parties at the date of signing. </li>
                  <li>Often an agreement will include provisions that take effect by reference to the date of the agreement (for example, royalties may be paid on each anniversary of the date of the licence contract). </li>
                  <li>Where there are several contracts concerned with the same subject matter, it may be essential to know the order in which they were made to determine which contract was first in time and therefore strongest in right.</li>
                  <li>Express stipulations on the exact time and place of the conclusion of the contract exclude the need to apply the theories in our law that determine time and place.</li>

                <p>Contracts typically include various types of clauses, each playing a particular role.

                  <li>Definition clauses</li>
                  <li>Interpretation clause</li>

                  <div class="bq-title">(i)	Suspensive or resolutive conditions and time periods </div>
                  <p>Conditions refer to events, the occurrence of which either triggers or discharges the duty of a party to a contract to perform the obligations created by the promises. It is important to understand that such conditions refer to conditions to performance of an obligation of a contract that has already been formed. An event that conditions performance may be either a “condition precedent” or a “condition subsequent”. A condition precedent is an event that must occur before performance of an obligation becomes due. Thus, the occurrence of the condition precedent triggers the obligation in the contract. In contract, a condition subsequent is an event whose occurrence discharges an obligation. The use of conditions precedent is more common in contract drafting. </p>
                  <p>Typical language for the expression of conditions are phrases such as: “if…, then…”; “provided that…”; “on condition that…”; “in the event that…”. In addition to express conditions written into the contract, some conditions may be implied from circumstances (such as usage of trade). The consequence for non-occurrence of an event that is made a condition of an obligation in a contract can be significant: the conditioned obligation of a party typically would become discharged.</p>
                  <div class="bq-title">(ii)	Clauses on breach of contract </div>
                  <p>Although promises are not necessarily made to be broken, that possibility must be considered when drafting a contract. What will constitute a breach of the agreement? What opportunity will the parties have to “cure” the breach?</p>
                  <div class="bq-title">(iii)	Liability, indemnity and exemption clauses</div>
                  <p>The indemnification portion of the contract deals with the allocation of liability in the event that all does not go as planned. Questions to be addressed in this portion of the contract include who will be liable for what, and to what extent.</p>
                  <div class="bq-title">(iv)	Performance guarantees and warranties </div>
                  <p>Most agreements will include affirmative duties owed to each party by the other party, in specific sections setting forth each party’s respective performance obligations. In addition, contracts generally include warranties, indemnities, and limitations on warranties.</p>
                  <p>Simply stated, a warranty is a promise. Warranties are, for the most part, promises concerning the future quality or performance of goods to be sold or leased, of real property to be sold or leased, of intellectual property to be sold or licensed, or of services to be rendered. A breach of warranty results if the quality or performance falls short of the promise made in the contract. In addition, commercial codes describe the express and implied warranties that arise in certain transactions. Some warranties are statements of facts. A breach of warranty would result if the fact warranted is untrue. However, whether the warranty is based on promise or statement of fact, breach of warranty has the same consequences as the breach of any other promise.</p>

                  The techniques and rules discussed here for the drafting are not prescriptive or peremptory but are suggestions to help the drafter to achieve his or her objectives. The main objective when drafting any contract is to ensure that a court will interpret the contract in the way the parties intended. Hutchison has summarised that standard ways of expressing particular concepts, which will be understood by the court as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use simple and direct language.</li>
                  <li>Sue short sentences and correct word order, preferably in an active voice.</li>
                  <li>Use defined terms where needed.</li>
                  <li>Order clauses in a logical and practical sequence.</li>
                  <li>Use techniques such as headings, numbering and punctuation to make the contract clear.</li>
                  <li>Specify clearly who has the duty to perform and to whom.  </li>
                </ul>

A common mistake is the use of the term “termination” as a synonym for the term “cancellation”<sup>205</sup>.  Traditional contract language often includes jargon and old-fashioned language that not part of everyday speech.</p>
                  <div class="bq-title">(ii) Sentence structure and length </div>
                  <p>Keep sentences short: average 15 words. If you go over 30, you run the risk that the reader may have a problem to follow you. As author, you are responsible for communicating your ideas efficiently and effectively.</p>
                  <div class="red-text"><strong>Note: </strong>the exception when using bullet points and lists.</div>
                  <div class="bq-title">(iii) Active and Passive voice</div>
                  <p>A serious problem in legal documents is overuse of passive verbs. Documents are more readable in English if the passive is avoided. Say again? You can make documents more readable in English by avoiding the passive. Documents in English are more readable when the drafter avoids the passive. If the English-language drafter avoids the passive, then the document becomes more readable.  Passive verbs hide responsibility and make sentences longer than needed.</p>

                      <li>Without “you” it is almost impossible to avoid passives, especially when stating obligations (imperatives). The cleanest way to avoid passives is to lead with verbs as commands, e.g., <em>provide, avoid, include, perform.</em></li>
                      <li>In this way it is even possible to avoid “you must”.</li>
                      <li>Active verbs become natural for writers who ask the important question – WHO does WHAT to WHOM? (In grammar: SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT).</li>

                  <p>In contractual drafting, it is generally advisable to avoid the Revisit Law203 for a recap on the common law classification of terms subjunctive form of verb. The subjunctive mood is a grammatical mood that expresses doubt, wishful thinking, and possibility and is not suited to the certainty that is the aim of formal contracts.

                    <div class="bq-title">Example 2</div>
                    <p>Subjunctive and indicative forms of verb:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Y shall pay X the sum of E1000,00 within 30 days of the date of this Agreement. </li>

                  <p>
                    From the example above, (i) with “shall” is indicative, (ii) with “should” is subjunctive. The latter is ungrammatical in the contractual context and should be avoided. 
                  </p>
